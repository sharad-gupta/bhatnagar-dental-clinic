					 	The first question in a patients mind is always..<br>
					 	Do I need a <b>Root Canal treatment? </b><br>
					 	To answer this question, we need to know how is our teeth. <br>
					 	Every tooth consists of three different layers. The outermost and hardest layer is enamel, and the second layer is dentin. The third is pulp, which is the cavernous space where the live tissue and nerve of each tooth is located.

						If for any reason the pulp space is exposed to the outside, the tissue becomes contaminated and eventually infected. The exposure of pulp happens in many circumstances, such as when you have a large cavity or a fractured tooth. Your dentist can explain the exact reason for damage to this tissue. In these cases, the treatment is usually root canal treatment.

						Root canal treatment is the process of going inside the pulp space and removing the infected, dead tissue. The space is then disinfected and sealed with special materials. Nowadays, root canal treatments are performed with advanced techniques and materials, making them far more comfortable and faster. After root canal treatment is complete, your restorative dentist will usually place a crown on your tooth to safeguard against fracture.

						If you have any questions about root canal treatments, give us a call today!
					</p>
					<span class="jumbo-heading">
						Root Canal Therapy <br>
						Do any of these symptoms sound familiar?
					</span> <br>
					<p class="para">
						-Significant, constant pain in the area of a specific tooth <br>
						-Discomfort that occurs when chewing on a certain side of the mouth <br>
						-Excessive oral sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures <br>
						-Tooth discoloration <br>
						You may be in need of root canal therapy. Root Canal therapy is a highly successful procedure that restores health to severely damaged teeth and saves them from the threat of extraction. Dr. Bhatnagar accesses the inside of the tooth and thoroughly cleans away bacteria. After sealing the area shut, a custom-made dental crown is placed over the tooth restoring the toothâ€™s full strength and function.
					</p>

					
					<span class="jumbo-heading">Infected/Inflamed Pulp Tissue </span> <br>
					<p class="para">
						Technically <q>root canal</q> is not the name of the procedure but refers instead simply to the natural cavity found in the center of the tooth. The pulp or pulp chamber is the soft area inside the root canal. The tooth&#39s nerve lies within the root canal. Occasionally, the internal soft tissue (or pulp) of the tooth becomes infected and can result in a serious infection if left untreated. 
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p class="para">
						In fact, the procedure that laymen refer to as a <q>root canal</q> is actually known as a pulpectomy to dentists. A pulpectomy is an endodontic treatment to cure an infected root canal. In the old days, damage to the core of a tooth usually meant it had to be removed. Today, however, a <q>root canal</q> procedure (or pulpectomy) disinfects and refills the inside of the tooth, thus preventing pain and limiting damage to the tooth.
					</p>
					<span class="jumbo-heading">The Root Canal Treatment Procedure </span> <br>
					<p class="para">
						The tooth is first anesthetized then a hole is made down into the pulp. Our dentist uses tiny instruments to extract the remaining pulp from the tooth, thoroughly disinfecting the tooth canal in the process. Once disinfected, the interior of the tooth is filled with an inert material that helps prevent further infection. <br>
						At Bhatnagar Dental Clinic, we are trained to perform endodontic treatment. <br>

						Contact us today to set up an appointment for a root canal treatment.
